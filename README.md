<h4> Structure </h4>
   1. The scripts director contains the running scripts for variant models. Change the parameter of CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to set  GPU ID for the training.<p>
   2. Knowledge transform module is implement in the MetaEmbeddingClassifier. <p>
   3. The model construction script is implemented in model.py under lib director.
